## ✨ **Features**

### 🎯 **Core Voting Features**
Our voting system has been thoughtfully designed to ensure flexibility and transparency:

1. **Custom Poll Creation**:
   - Easily create polls with titles, descriptions, and options.
   - Set voting duration and eligibility criteria.
   - Add metadata and categorize your polls.

2. **Secure Vote Casting**:
   - One vote per wallet per poll—no double voting.
   - Real-time vote confirmation with transaction verification.
   - Weighted voting options for advanced use cases.

3. **Live Results & Analytics**:
   - Dynamic visualization of voting distributions.
   - Historical tracking for comprehensive analysis.
   - Export results in multiple formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## 💻 **Development Workflow**

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Set Up a Local Solana Validator**:
   ```bash
   solana-test-validator
   ```
   This enables a simulated blockchain environment for development.

2. **Build the Program**:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

4. **Deploy Your Program**:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ```

5. **Run the Next.js Frontend**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔒 **Security Highlights**

We prioritize security at every level:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Wallet-based login and transaction signature verification.
   - Permission validation for poll creation and voting.

2. **Tamper Prevention**:
   - State verification checks ensure vote integrity.
   - Anti-spam mechanisms (e.g., rate limiting).

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All voting data stored on-chain for transparency.
   - Real-time data integrity checks and monitoring.

## 🧪 **Testing Framework**

Robust testing is key to ensuring reliability. Here's how we test:

### Types of Tests
1. **Unit Tests**:
   Validate individual functionalities like poll creation or vote counting.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   Test interactions between the Solana program and the Next.js frontend.

3. **Edge Case Scenarios**:
   Ensure proper handling of exceptions like invalid wallets or expired polls.

### Running Tests
```bash
anchor test
```

## 🌐 **Frontend with Next.js**

We've embraced **Next.js** for its versatility and modern features:

### Features
1. Server-side Rendering (SSR) for faster page loads.
2. API Routes for seamless backend integration.
3. Optimized performance with built-in caching.

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js** (version 13+)
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **Web3.js** for blockchain interactions.
